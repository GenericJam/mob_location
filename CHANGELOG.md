## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- Signed release: the published package now carries a verified Ed25519
  signature (shared mob first-party key, regenerated in CI on every
  release). Generated apps trust it via `config :mob, :trusted_plugins`,
  so it clears the plugin signature gate without `acknowledge_unsafe_plugins`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- Removed a stale `priv/mob_plugin.sig` / `mob_plugin.pub` that shipped in 0.1.1.
  It was signed before the 0.1.1 manifest gained `:screens`, so the signature no
  longer matched the manifest and the plugin signature gate hard-failed
  (`invalid_signature`, not bypassable by `acknowledge_unsafe_plugins`). Now
  unsigned, consistent with the other first-party capability plugins.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- Bundled `MobLocation.DemoScreen` — a ready-to-run sample (get-once / start / stop, live coords) declared in the manifest's `:screens`, so a generated app can kick the tires on activation. It's pure-Elixir and hot-pushable; the plugin is now tier 3 (NIF + screens). Delete the screen + its `:screens` entry in a real app.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-12

Initial release. Device location (GPS / network) for Mob apps.

- `MobLocation.start/2` / `stop/1` with updates delivered via `handle_info`.
- Extracted from mob core in the 0.7.0 plugin-extraction wave.
- Requires `mob ~> 0.7`.
